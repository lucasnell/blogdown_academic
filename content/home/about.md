# About

I'm a PhD student in [Zoology](http://zoology.wisc.edu/) at the
[University of Wisconsin–Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/), in
[Dr. Anthony Ives'](http://zoology.wisc.edu/tony-ives.htm) lab.


I am most fascinated by how complex networks of species interactions drive community
structure and evolutionary outcomes—and how they themselves are shaped by natural
selection. I seek to pursue these questions using a combination of computational,
experimental, and comparative field approaches.
