# About

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Integrative Biology](http://ibio.wisc.edu/) 
at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/). My advisor is 
[Dr. Anthony Ives](http://ives.labs.wisc.edu).


I am most fascinated by how complex networks of species interactions drive community
structure and evolutionary outcomes—and how they themselves are shaped by natural
selection. I seek to pursue these questions using a combination of computational,
experimental, and comparative field approaches.
